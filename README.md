Introduction:-
•	Bullying is an intentional, aggressive and repeated behavior that could be physical, verbal, sexual or mental. With rise of social media coupled with the Covid-19 pandemic, cyberbullying has reached all time highs. As social media usage becomes increasingly prevalent in every age group, most of us rely on this essential medium for our day-to-day communication.    

•	Such large usage means that cyberbullying can effectively impact anyone at anytime or anywhere. The anonymity of internet makes such attacks more difficult to stop than traditional bullying.  

Statistics
•	On April 15th 2020, UNICEF issued a warning in response to the increased risk of cyberbullying.  
•	As per Times Of India 52,974 incidents of cyber crimes were reported in year 2021 in India.  
•	Around 85 per cent of Indian children have reported being cyberbullied as well as having cyberbullied someone else at rates well over twice the international average.  
•	Nearly 8 out of 10 individuals are subject to the different types of cyberbullying in India. Out of these around 63% faced online abuses and insults, and 59% were subject to false rumours and gossips for degrading their image.  
•	Thus, we need to aware people about what Cyber-bullying is, and also take some measure to prevent it such that we can live in a safe environment without fear of being bullied.   

For this purpose we will use "Cyberbullying classification" dataset extracted using twitter API, which contains 47k tweets. For further description about the datasets kindly visit kaggle.  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/cyberbullying-classification

The Implementation of code is on Google Colab Notebook. Link for colab notebook (in progress) https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SRZxnNPCU1KAWVrmrchpXw6wUxr3ibgg?usp=share_link
